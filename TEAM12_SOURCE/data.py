In this class, you will learn how to:

- Closely examine the “life story” that has brought you to where you are today.
- Shift your thinking and instead of being part of the society factory, learn how to focus on life as a journey to be experienced fully, rather than a means to an end.
- Align your ‘life’ views and ‘work’ view, because more often than not making money and having meaning in your life are not always perfectly aligned.
- Fixing dysfunctional attitudes by understanding the root of things that might be blocking you.
- Understand what gives you energy and what sucks you dry, so you can design a life that fills you up.

*You will also read a book on your own from a book list that I will provide and share it with the class as a presentation.''',
